OAI Gateway Relay
===============

Web Socket Server for monitoring and managing Inter-Tel/Mitel PBX Phone systems using the OAI Toolkit.

This is written for version 8 and above of the toolkit with minor legacy support for older versions.

This project relies on my <a href="https://github.com/willitscale/simplejavawebsocket">Simple Java Web Socket</a> project to work.
